# StudentsDetailsBank...Flask
## A webapp for storing essential school-related information


* A basic webapp built using Flask, a python web framework.
* It helps beginner full stack developers or anyone who is interested to have a scope of how things work
* In a normal and standard situation, both the backend and frontend are built separately but since this is just a demo project, they'll be combined
* This webapp contains three essential parts: model, view, controller
* The model part [models.py] handles the database structure
* The view component  refers to the user interface section conventionally stored in the templates folder
* .....alongside the html in this folder, you can also do some styling if wish and client side programming using javascript, but these staticfiles has to be stored in an entirely different folder called static
* The last but least (controller) is the part connects the model (database) to the UI and chooses how data is being rendered
* .....for simplicity sake i splitted by controller files into categories:: auth.py, main.py and update.py

## Prerequisite
* Before running the program, ensure you have all the required packeges installed by running "pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal"...
* If you encounter any problem with pip check youtube for a solution

## What's next?
* Learn more about web application development frameworks like flask which was used for this project or Django if you are interested in working on larger projects...
